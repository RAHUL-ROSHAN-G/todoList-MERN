# todoList-MERN

## I have uploaded only the important files here. Below I have mentioned how to download the files and run the program.

### In client side
```
npm create vite@latest
```
- enter project name
- select react
- select javascript
```
cd <project name>
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm install axios react-icons
```
### Now inside the "src" folder replace App.jsx, App.css.
### And add the rest of the file i.e., Create.jsx and Home.jsx file 

And run the program:-
```
npm run dev
```

### In server side
- open another terminal
- create server file
```
mkdir server
cd server
```
```
npm init -y
```
```
npm install express mongoose cors
```
```
npm install nodemon
```
```
npm start
```

- In this server folder it should contain index.js file
- create Models folder

```
mkdir Models
cd Models
```

- In this Models folder it should contain Todo.js file.
